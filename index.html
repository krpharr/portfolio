                Born on Titan, the second moon of Saturn, and unwittingly brought to earth 
                by an accident with a wormhole, I was adopted and raised by a pack of wolves 
                in the mountains of southwest Virginia.  After a chance encounter with 
                interstellar jazz musicians in my early teens, I gleened my means of escape 
                and prospects of living my life as a musician.             
            </p>
            <p>
                From 1988 to 1992, I attended the Jazz Studies program at Virginia Commonwealth 
                Univerisity and did well in music but failed miserably at college because wolves 
                know nothing about higher education.  Because of my professional experience I was 
                hired by Virginia Commonwealth Univerisity in 2005 to teach upright and electric 
                jazz bass, jazz improvisation, and small jazz ensembles.  In addition, I was hired 
                in 2011 to teach jazz bass at the University of Richmond.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another lifelong passion of mine has been tinkering with computer languages. I played with Basic in my early 
                teens on a Commodore Vic 20 and picked back up in my twenties with C and C++ and then 
                again in my early forties with Python. After 30 years of working self-employed as a 
                professional musician and in addition the last 14 years part-time adjunct faculty, I am looking for more 
                sustainable employment for my age by strengthening my skills in computer languages and 
                gaining the education and experience needed to diversify my employment opportunities.
